# Project 2 Stardew Valley
## 09-20-2022 12:24
Started stardew valley project
### Task.java
implemented the Task class using the interface file.

### MaxHeap.java
Getting started with max heap.
Currently need to find how to switch two objects in an index. 
This is for the maxHeapify method.

need to find what values for constructor

TODO Fix getTaskType()

11:47
TODO I have been using array.length to determine the size
of the heap, but this is the size of the array not the heap.
I need to change all the a.length to heapsize
and make getters and setters for heapsize.

14:58
I completed the above todo.
16:06
made a new branch where i have the array built into MaxHeap class
I changed all the methods so instead of passing in parameter array A
of type Task it now how it built it.

Find out if MaxHeap's getIndex, increaseKey, and max should use try catch
         
Read insert pseudocode to find what the following means:
    // TODO map x to index heap-size in the array
Read increase pseudocde to find what follwing means:
    // priority queue objects to array indices

need to do more testing on BuildMaxHeap. I have done three levels on the left
but not the right.

Also I should have more Null cases. I mean where I try the opposite
of how my test cases should work. That is the true way to test something

TODO: iron out the javaDocs they are still inconsistent.

I switched the project to Eclipse IDE.

I have implemented all the files. I am only now playing with the output.
My priority works fine in the beginning, but as more and more tasks are
added it starts to have more and more problems.

The reason, I have discovered, is because priorityQueue update is not taking waiting time into
consideration, and neither is my CompareTo method in Task. if two tasks have the same
priority, then the one that is longer should be higher on the list. because I did not take
this into consideration, tasks stay in the queue longer then they should. 

//TODO fix MyPriorityQueue.update.
//TODO fix Task.compareTo so that if two Tasks have the same priority, the one
with the larger waiting time goes on top of the queue.

###11:15
the biggest problem is from heapify. I need to implement
compareTo to work with waitingTime. And make it so that waitingTime updates.
made branch fixHeapify for these purposes
//TODO update compareTo to work with waitingTime.
//TODO create waitingTime Tester.
//TODO find out why MyPriorityQueue.update does not
increment waitingTime.

###11:43
completed compareTo and test for compareTo
